      <h1>What You Become</h1>
      <p>A drafter
        If you’re looking to become a drafter, you need—at the very least—an associate’s degree. As we’ve said, this can be completed at a community college, career training school or college/university. You can opt to specialize in a particular field, e.g. electrical, mechanical or architectural. Once you’ve completed your degree, you can choose to further your education with a bachelor’s, or start looking for a job. Most opt for a bachelor’s degree due to increased job prospects.
        
        With regards to licenses, you can opt to get American Design Drafting Association (ADDA) certification. While not mandatory, it can improve your résumé and emphasize your competence and knowledge in your chosen field of expertise. 
        
        An engineer
        Requirements for engineers are slightly higher than drafters. You need to complete a bachelor’s degree in a subject relevant to your sector. With engineering being highly competitive, you might also opt for a master’s degree to set you apart from the rest. 
        
        As is the case with drafters, it’s not mandatory for engineers to have specific certifications. That being said, if you’re eyeing up positions like senior mechanical engineer, a Professional Engineering (PE) license will set you up nicely.
        
        An architect
        To start, you need a bachelor’s degree in architecture. If you’ve had no prior training, this can take up to 5 years. You’ll also want to add on a master’s degree which can take between 1 to 5 years. And that’s not even half of it! You need to complete at least 3 years of experience in a paid internship. 
        
        Unlike drafters and engineers, architects are all required to sit for the Architect Registration Examination (ARE). If you’re looking to bolster your résumé, you might look towards further certification with NCARB.</p>
    <H1>DRAFTING</H1>
    <h3> Draftimg</h3>

    <p> 
        Drafters can use SolidWorks to create 2D and 3D drawings. 
        They’ll work with engineers to put together blueprints, plans, parts and assembly drawings. 
        Furthermore, drafters will have to specify aspects like tolerance, dimensions and materials.
         CAD drafters, therefore, are fundamental in the process of creating structures, machines and products. 
         One of the benefits of CAD is that drafters no longer have to create and continue modifying real-world prototypes. 
         Everything can be modified and improved directly in SolidWorks. Drafters can even test real-world scenarios in simulations. 
    </p>
    <h3>Mechanical Drafters</h3>
    <p>If the name didn’t clue you in, mechanical drafters specialize in creating and preparing drawings for various machinery, mechanical tools and devices. Whether it’s medical equipment or heavy industry tools, mechanical drafters play a huge part. Accuracy plays a heavy role in these technical drawings—drafters are required to indicate dimensions, assembly methods and mechanical installation infrastructure. Mechanical drafters can expect to work alongside engineers, manufacturers and architects.

        Mechanical drafters are required to verify design calculations, which is where SolidWorks can play a big part, as simulation sequences can be used to test stress and tolerance. This means that drafters can quickly assess a product’s functionality and make necessary changes quickly and efficiently. </p>
       <h2>Electrical Drafters</h2>
       <p>Electrical drafters create technical illustrations, wiring diagrams and connection specifications that are used as visual aids for complex equipment and machinery. These drawings will consequently be used by electrical workers who are installing or repairing equipment. Electrical drafters will ultimately work towards creating master drawings—to scale—which will give engineers an idea as to where these installations will be placed in existing facilities.

        Accuracy is key. Electrical drafters have to take note of exact dimensions and specifications. For example, they would need to look at factors that might affect the installation, such as distance for wire. Fortunately, SolidWorks comes with a range of simulation capabilities.</p>

    <H1>DESIGN</H1>
    <h3>Interior design</h3>
    <p>Interior designers create interior spaces—taking into consideration client specifications and aesthetics. Space plays a huge role in projects, as interior designers need to consider how to use free space and how people will move around it. Using SolidWorks, interior designers can create detailed floor plans and layouts—even including electrical layouts. 

        Designers need to specify materials and interior furnishings, ranging from lighting to the walls to the flooring. Visual tools are incredibly useful in allowing designers to show their full ideas and concepts to clients in a clear and effective manner. To make it even more realistic, designers can choose to present clients with full walkthroughs</p>

        <h3>Industrial design</h3>
        <p>It’s the job of industrial designers to consider how people use products, and to test different design types to determine which one is safest, most efficient and ideal for the target audience. Working with engineers, industrial designers also need to determine whether their design is indeed possible. Whilst creating their product in SolidWorks, industrial designers will look at material and production costs.

            Using analysis tools, industrial designers will evaluate their designs, looking at safety, appearance and overall functionality. They’ll continue to revise their product until it is the best possible model. Much like interior designers, they’ll also present their designs to clients via visual tools and walkthroughs.</p>
